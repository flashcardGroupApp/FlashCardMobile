###FlashCardsGame

We created a flash card game that utilizes login/register and card randomizer via rails requests. We implemented NSTimer to count down from 30 seconds for the hard mode.

--

- Login/Register

	- import foundation

	- UIWebViewDelegate

	- RailsRequest

- NSTimer for hard mode

- Populated decks according to which deck was chosen. Checks for right answer from an array of dictionaries and goes to new card once answered.
